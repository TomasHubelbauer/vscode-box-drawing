> A VS Code extension for simplifying box drawing with Unicode and ASCII.

This extension only works on MarkDown files!

Unfortunately, due to VS Code API limitations, direct mouse drawing mode cannot be used and instead selections have to be utilized.

To alleviate the pain of using this mode, we'll soon bring in a command which pre-spaces a page of the document to make making selections convenient.

## Features
